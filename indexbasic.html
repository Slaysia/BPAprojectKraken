			<h2>HISTORY</h2>
				<p> Before Washington was given its current name, it was often referred to as the “Federal City,” and did not received the name of “Washington D.C.” until a meeting on September 9, 1791. The name “Washington D.C.” comes from the countries patriotic past. “Washington” was chosen to honor the first President George Washington, while “D.C.” (or District of Columbia) comes from patriotic poetry and songs after the Revolutionary War. “Columbia” is a term that was used to idealize America’s qualities as a land of liberty. Washington was founded on July 16, 1790 when George Washington chose the precise location for the nation’s capital, however Congress would not have the first official meeting in the new capital until November 1, 1800. The city is home to all three branches of the US government, as well as many national monuments and museums, the National Mall, 177 foreign embassies, and the headquarters of many federal organizations.</p>
