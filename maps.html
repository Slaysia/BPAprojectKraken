    <h2>Traffic and Transportation</h2>
    <div class="body" >
      <p>Travelling in D.C. can be quite an experience especially if you have never been before. Luckily though, there are ways around it or to at least get you through it without ripping your hair out. Traffic in Washington is unpredictable and can change at any time. That is why many people decide to use the "Metro Subway Stysem" to get around. If you do decide to drive yourself you are likely to have the most trouble finding somewhere to park. Street parking around attractions can be very limited and garage parking can be expensive. But with many one way streets and street circles if you are not used to the style of driving, it is probably best to use public transportation.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Rush Hour: 6am - 9:30am; 3:30pm - 6:30pm</li>
        <li>Tuesdays and Fridays are the most busy days of the week.</li>
        <li>Sundays are the slowest days.</li>
        <li>30 minute walk between Lincoln Memoria and U.S. Capitol</li>
      </ul>

     	</ul>

      <h3>Riding the Metro</h3>

        <p>With horrendous traffic and limited parking options, don’t bother driving or taking cabs; instead, use public transportation and your own two feet to roam the city. But be warned that there IS a proper way to ride public transportation, particularly the Metro. Being relatively new, the Metro is quite clean, air-conditioned, and Internet-friendly (at the stations and overground).</p>

        <h4>Metro Etiquette</h4>

        <ul>
        	<li>When riding the escalator, stand to your right, walk to your left. Standing in a twosome that blocks the left side is strongly (and often loudly) discouraged by your fellow Metro riders.</li>
        	<li>When waiting to board a train, let riders exit the train first before trying to board. If the train is particularly crowded and you are standing in a doorway, step just outside the train doorway to allow your fellow riders room to exit.</li>
        	<li>Another important note if the train is crowded: move to the middle of the car so others can board. You will have time to exit when you arrive at your stop.</li>
        	<li>During peak hours, trains arrive often. Don’t try to board a train that is too full. The automatic doors are very sensitive and if they can’t close, the train operator may offload the entire train because a door stopped working.</li>
        	<li>Each car usually has several seats for handicapped riders. Please don’t use these seats if there is a rider that needs to sit down.</li>
        	<li>Be sure and have your SmarTrip card out and ready to swipe when you go through the gate. Riders move through quickly and holding up the line is discouraged.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>How Much Does it Cost?</h5>

		      <p> Metro fares are calculated by how many stops you travel and vary during peak and off-peak hours. During peak hours, most fares range from $2.25 to $6 per trip. During off-peak hours, fares typically range from $1.85 to $3.85. Metro riders must pay via <a class="h5a" href="https://www.wmata.com/fares/smartrip/">SmarTrip card <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i></a>. While the Metro can be a very busy place, most of your fellow riders are friendly and will point you in the right direction. There is also a station manager at each station. Don’t be afraid to ask if you have questions about navigating the Metro!</p>
