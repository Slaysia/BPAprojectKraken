          <p> 
          Going to be visiting Washington D.C.? Here's a little information and a few tips for you to hopefully help get the best out of your experience at the nations capital. D.C. has a population of approximately 704,000 people making it the 22nd most populated city in the United States. The city covers an area of about 68.34 miles and has a population density of approximately 11,400 people per square mile. Many people travel into the city during the day for work, causing the population to swell during the day.
          <br><br>
          The weather in Washington is for the most part pretty consistent and reasonable. During the Spring and Fall seasons the temperature typically ranges anywhere from the mid 50's to the low 70's, but can occationally dip down into the 30's so it might be thoughtful to keep a jacket. Winters are pretty chilly with temperatures sticking around the 20's, 30's, and 40's and is also the least busy season as far as tourism. Summers on the other hand, maintains a temperature around the upper 80's and a decent humidity level. Summer is also the busiest time of year for tourism in Washington, with many locals leaving for their own vacations. The city averages around 3 inches of precipitation a month, most of it being rain, so it's probably pretty smart to take an umbrella with you reguardless of what time of year it is.</p>

      <h2>Things to Know When Visiting Washington</h2>

        <dl>
          <dt>Wear comfortable shoes</dt>
            <dd>This is almost a must while visiting D.C. Even though you probably plan on riding a bus or using another form of transportation, you'll want something comfortable while walking around all the attractions.</dd>
          <dt class="dt">Bring a refillable water bottle</dt>
            <dd>This will save you from having to spend a bunch of money buying from the street vendors. Not only will it also cut down on waste, you can refill it at any water fountain!</dd>
          <dt class="dt">Visit on a weekend</dt> 
            <dd>The city adjusts mainly to business travelers, so hotels tend to increase prices during the week and offer discounts on the weekend.</dd>
          <dt class="dt">Some attractions require advanced planning</dt>
            <dd>Many of Washington's attractions open to visit whenever you would like, but some attractions such as the White House, Supreme Court, and the Washington Monument require a reservation ticket and advanced planning.</dd>
          <dt class="dt">Dress attire</dt>
            <dd>Of course, there isn’t any official dress code, but the conservative political nature of the city finds its inhabitants veering slightly towards the dressier side. Think classic with a touch of prep and you’ll blend right in. Winter attire is generally dressier as it is, but the summer attire is where you might opt for collared shirts, khakis, etc. By all means, be comfortable, but ditch the super short shorts, halter tops, ripped shorts, etc.</dd>
